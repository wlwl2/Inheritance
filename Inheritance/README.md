# Inheritance

When you define a class to derive from another class, the derived class
implicitly gains all the members of the base class, except for its constructors
and finalizers. The derived class can thereby reuse the code in the base class
without having to re-implement it. In the derived class, you can add more
members. In this manner, the derived class extends the functionality of the base
class.
