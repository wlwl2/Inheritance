// Derived classes can also override inherited members by providing an alternate
// implementation. In order to be able to override a member, the member in the
// base class must be marked with the `virtual` keyword. By default, base class
// members are not marked as `virtual` and cannot be overridden. Attempting to
// override a non-virtual member, as the following example does, generates
// compiler error CS0506: " cannot override inherited member because it is not
// marked virtual, abstract, or override.
